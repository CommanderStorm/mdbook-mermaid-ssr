# Forest Theme Diagram

This chapter demonstrates the forest theme configuration with green-tinted color schemes.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Forest Theme] --> B[Green Colors]
    B --> C[Natural Look]
    C --> D[Earthy Tones]
    D --> E[Consistent Styling]
```

The diagram above should use the forest theme's characteristic green color palette.

## Another Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Start --> Process
    Process --> Decision{Check}
    Decision -->|Pass| Success
    Decision -->|Fail| Retry
    Retry --> Process
    Success --> End
```

This flowchart should also reflect the forest theme colors in the generated SVG.
